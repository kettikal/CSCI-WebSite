    <p>Two expeditions I have gone were completely different both in nature and its practices. The first expedition was purely archaeological. I was living in Bayan-Zhurek valley, the mountainous area near Taldykorgan city, South-East Kazakhstan, for the archaeological summer school DMAP. The second expedition was a mix of archaeological and socio-cultural fieldtrip with elements of interview, and other interesting archaeological methods that I did not practice in the first.</p>

    <h2 id="list">Why was it so unique?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Nature. From the very start I knew I would enjoy living in nature, but I didn't realize that I would connect with it.</li>
        <li>I started noticing the flora of the area, insects, the musical assembly of birds, the silence of the nature when there is literally no sound except you breathing in the world.</li>
        <li>I saw rain going on in the hundreds of km away from us.</li>
        <li>I heard thunder and storm so loud, coming to your direction, that it was the scariest thing at that moment of my existence. You fear your tent to be blown away and get the feeling of awe of the Nature.</li>
        <li>I saw sunset every day, how tremendous Sky, sublime Clouds, majestic Mountains changed its colours from blue/white/green to pink and purple and black, blue/grey. Contemplating for hours, I enjoyed the soft wind that quietly whispers with flowers and trees and messes my short hair up ðŸ˜Œ</li>
        <li>I was scared at 2am the first night of the camp when I heard a dog howling weirdly. And I was frightened when I heard 6 dogs howling at 11pm lying in my tent one day trying to sleep while realizing they were jackals, not dogs ðŸ« </li>
        <li>I started looking at the sky for the weather, to see if it would get dark before we go the internet hill (20-40 min to get from the camp), and to see if it is going to rain (= we are going to have a break from work when it rains).</li>
    </ul>
